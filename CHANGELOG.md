# Changelog

Notable changes, and what they cost or bought. Versions follow semver on the
**crate**; the *format* version is a separate axis and moves only when the wire
format changes incompatibly. A crate major bump does not imply a format break,
and the facade asserts the two are independent.

---

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-29

Format stays at `smysl/0.1`, kernel at `smysl.kernel/0.1`. A record type was
*added*, which an older reader degrades rather than refuses, so nothing on the
wire changed incompatibly.

The theme, if it has one: **a document should survive contact with machines and
still be legible to the person who has to answer for it.** Every item below is
some version of that, and most of them started as a gap the previous release
knew about and had written down.

### Breaking

Small, but real. Each one changes something a script or a reader could depend on.

- **A labelled unit now yields two records**, so `check` reports more records
  than before — `F1-incident.smy` went from 13 to 21. `units` is the figure to
  read when you want to know how much document you have; `records` is the figure
  to read when you want to know what a merge or a round trip has to carry. All 34
  documented counts in the manual were re-measured.
- **Exit code `11`** joins the contract. A script testing `= 10` for "staged"
  should test `>= 10`.
- **A typo in a unit type is now a warning, not an error.** `@clai c/a { … }` was
  `SMY-E001` and is now `SMY-W010` naming `clai`. This is irreducible rather than
  a preference: a tool cannot distinguish a typo from a kernel type added next
  year, because the two are structurally identical. `--strict` restores the
  failure, and the message is more precise than it was.
- **`fmt` refuses `--check` and `--write` on a CBOR store** with exit `2` rather
  than reinterpreting them. `--check` asks whether *text* is spelled canonically
  and a log is canonical by construction; `--write` would convert a binary store
  to text in place.
- **Live tests no longer run on the strength of a key.** `SMYSL_EVAL_LIVE`,
  `SMYSL_INGEST_LIVE` and `SMYSL_DEEPSEEK` must be set. A credential in the
  environment is not consent to spend it.

### Added

- **`Record::LabelBinding`** (envelope type code 10). Labels now survive a store
  round trip. Before this they survived a parse and not a store, so a document
  that had been through `merge` came back with every reference spelled as a bare
  `b3:…` uid — valid, re-checking clean, and unreadable. That broke the format's
  central claim for exactly the multi-agent case it exists to serve, and the
  evaluation harness never saw it because it measures claims and hedges, not
  legibility.

  The binding is a separate record rather than a field because a label is not
  identity: inside hashed content, renaming one would produce a different unit.

- **Comment syntax**: `#` or `//` at column 0. Both markers, because an HJSON
  header inside a record already accepted both, so the surface had been
  rejecting between records what it accepted within one.

  A comment is a comment *wherever* it sits, including inside a body — which
  costs a body the ability to open a line with either marker. The reverse was
  implemented first and was worse: a body runs from the gist to the next record,
  so a comment between two records fell inside that range and became the previous
  unit's body, inventing content out of a note.

  No record carries a comment, so canonical form cannot reproduce one and `fmt`
  warns before dropping any — this project recommends `fmt --write` as a
  pre-commit habit, which makes silent deletion of a reviewer's notes the
  difference between a formatter and a hazard.

- **`SchemaId::UnknownKernel`**, so a kernel type added by a later version
  decodes, reports `SMY-W010`, and re-encodes byte for byte. It used to fail the
  whole record with `SMY-E004` — corruption, not degradation — while an unknown
  *record* type and an unknown *extension* type both degraded correctly.

  Decoding and surface parsing need opposite behaviour here and cannot share one
  function, so `parse_forward` is a second entry point; `parse` still refuses.

- **Exit code `11`, `StagedWithCorrections`.** `ingest` knew rule M had corrected
  the model and had no way to say so; under `--yes` it returned plain `0`, making
  the outcome most worth knowing about indistinguishable from nothing having
  happened. A refinement of `Staged` rather than a failure — the batch is intact
  and every corrected unit is in it.

- **`fixtures/corpus/F9-forward-compat.smy`**, so the degradation paths are in
  the conformance corpus rather than only in unit tests.

- **`scripts/verify-doc-output.py`** and `make doc-output`: replays the manual's
  documented commands against the real binary. The manual quotes ~190 command
  outputs and nothing checked them, which is how 34 of them went wrong at once.

### Fixed

- **`merge` ignored `--format surface`**, so a merged store was the one artifact
  nobody could read back: `fmt` takes surface text, and piping the log into it
  fails on invalid UTF-8. Fixing it exposed that `write_surface` emitted `@doc`
  headers nowhere and thread steps naming canonical uids that its own parser
  rejected — the writer was producing documents the reader refused.
- **`fmt` could not read a CBOR store** although `check` read both forms, which
  is odd for the command whose job is making a store readable.
- **`SMY-W014` was declared and never emitted.** An unknown record type was
  preserved in perfect silence. Preservation is rule X working; saying nothing
  about it is how a reader comes to believe they have seen the whole document.
  `SMY-W010` had a milder version of the same problem — it fired only when `--as`
  named a consumer profile, though a type this *build* cannot interpret is the
  stronger fact and does not depend on being asked.
- **Format sniffing** was duplicated in two places and adding comments broke
  both, one of them silently. Now one function.

### Not fixed, and why

- **`merge` does not persist the contentions it detects.** Reported as a bug
  during this cycle and it is not one: detection is not monotone, so writing a
  finding into an append-only log would make a stale detection permanent and
  break the associativity rule U promises. Detection stays a derived view of the
  union.
- **OpenAI and Anthropic mappers remain untested.** Blocked on credentials, and
  shipping untested network code is worse than shipping none.
- **`pack` and `salience` recompute over the whole store per call.** No evidence
  yet that it bites, and no measurement either — which is the actual gap. A
  benchmark, not an optimisation, is the next step.

### Known limits

- A body cannot open a line with `#` or `//`; there is no escape syntax yet.
- Sixteen counts in the manual were re-measured by rebuilding each example from
  the listing its chapter prints. Where a chapter does not print the file, a file
  of the shape the prose states was used instead.
- Exit code `11` is not in RFC Appendix E, and is recorded as a divergence.
